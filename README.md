# Final-Project
# How to run the program: The program will automatically run once the user is prompted to press the 'Enter' button and does so. 
# Requirements for the program: There are no requirements, just to have fun!
# What is it/How does it work: Our program runs a Hangman Game. The game requires the user to guess letters that make up a random hidden word. 
            # Each letter the user guesses correctly will reveal that letter in the hidden word. Each guess that the user 
            # guesses incorrectly will be added to the already used list and a body part will be added to the Hangman. 
            # Once the body of the Hangman is complete, after 10 guesses, the game will end unsuccessfully. If the user guesses 
            # all correct letters and completes the hidden word within the 10 guesses, they win!
